# PopMonitor/Pop Mart Restock Tracker (v2)
Deprecated Tracker: https://github.com/CrystalChiu/PopmartRestockBot

This is a lightweight and performant web scraper designed to track product restocks and updates on [Pop Mart's US site](https://www.popmart.com/us). This version is a complete overhaul of the original tracker, built with improved performance, better reliability, and streamlined code structure. It also supports real-time alerts via Discord.
