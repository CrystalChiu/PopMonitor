# Pop Mart Restock Tracker (v2)
Deprecated Tracker: https://github.com/CrystalChiu/PopmartRestockBot

This is a lightweight and performant web scraper designed to track product restocks and updates on [Pop Mart's US site](https://www.popmart.com/us). This version is a complete overhaul of the original tracker, built with improved performance, better reliability, and streamlined code structure. It also supports real-time alerts via Discord.

## Features

- Efficiently scrapes all product listings across paginated search results
- Detects new products, price changes, and restocked inventory
- Writes bulk updates to MongoDB when changes are detected
- Sends Discord alerts for new or changed products
- Uses Puppeteer for fast and headless page navigation
- Structured and maintainable codebase

* We have bypassed the need for Chromium or Pupeteer Stealth in this version

## Additional Comments:
- The discord link will be publically available soon!
